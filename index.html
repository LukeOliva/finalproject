<h1>What are the NBA playoffs?</h1>
<p>The NBA Playoffs are the exhilarating postseason tournament that determines the champion of the National Basketball Association. After the regular season, the top 8 teams from each conference — the Eastern and Western conferences — compete in a series of intense, high-stakes matchups. The playoffs consist of four rounds: the First Round, the Conference Semifinals, the Conference Finals, and finally, the NBA Finals. Each series is played in a best-of-seven format, meaning the first team to win four games advances. The NBA Playoffs feature the league's most talented players, unforgettable moments, and dramatic storylines, all building toward the crowning of the NBA champion. From buzzer-beaters to rivalries, the playoffs are where legends are made, and history is written.

<p>The Western Conference in the 2024–2025 NBA season has been a battleground of powerhouse teams, rising stars, and high-stakes matchups. Known for its depth and competitiveness, the West has showcased elite talent and thrilling performances all season long. Franchises like the Denver Nuggets, led by reigning MVP Nikola Jokić, and the Minnesota Timberwolves, with their dominant defensive presence, have emerged as top contenders. Meanwhile, experienced teams like the Golden State Warriors and Los Angeles Lakers have fought to maintain playoff positioning amid fierce competition from younger, fast-rising squads like the Oklahoma City Thunder and Sacramento Kings. The Western Conference continues to be a true test of resilience, strategy, and star power as the postseason approaches.

<p>The Eastern Conference in the 2024–2025 NBA season has been defined by elite defense, emerging superstars, and tightly contested rivalries. At the top of the standings, the Boston Celtics have dominated with their balanced offense and league-best defense, while the Milwaukee Bucks, powered by Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard, remain a serious title contender. The Philadelphia 76ers, despite injuries, continue to stay competitive behind strong team chemistry and Tyrese Maxey’s breakout season. Meanwhile, teams like the Cleveland Cavaliers and New York Knicks have made their mark with gritty play and playoff-level intensity. With younger teams like the Indiana Pacers and Orlando Magic showing promise, the Eastern Conference is as dynamic as ever — setting the stage for an dexciting postseason run.
